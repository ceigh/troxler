troxler
-------

This is a simple implementation of an optical illusion called the
Troxler Effect.

More information can be found here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troxler%27s_fading

This library simply draws a random effect pattern on the canvas.

NPM: https://npmjs.com/troxler


Installation
------------

You can install it like any other package:

  yarn add troxler


Usage
-----

Create canvas element on your page:

  <canvas width='300' height='300'></canvas>

Pass link to element to drawTroxler function:

  import { drawTroxler, clearCanvas } from 'troxler'

  const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas')
  drawTroxler(canvas)

  // with options:
  // drawTroxler(canvas, options)

  // to clear
  clearCanvas(canvas)


Options
-------

You can provide additional options:

  // default values
  // colors can be presented as hex, rgb, rgba or hsl
  const options = {
    bg: '#fff',      // fill bg color; false for transparent
    marker: '#000',  // dot in center with provided color; false to not draw
    brighter: false, // make image brighter
    worker: true     // draw on canvas in separate thread
  }
  drawTroxler(canvas, options)


Effect
------

Fix the dot in the center and do not move your gaze for a few
seconds. If the required immobility is achieved, the colored
pattern shapes will disappear.
